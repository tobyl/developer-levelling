# Developer Levelling resources

Welcome to the Developer Levelling resources!

Hub Customer Central recognizes four developer levels:

- Level I
- Level II
- Leve III
- Senior Developer

Obviously we're interested in knowledge, skills and experience. However, we're not just looking for coding abilities - we also value communication, collaboration, leadership and business savvy!

You can check out the matrix for a simple guide to the relevant hard and soft skills, or you can read an overview of each of the levels.
